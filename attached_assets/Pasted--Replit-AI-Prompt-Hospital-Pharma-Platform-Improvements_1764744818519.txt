# Replit AI Prompt - Hospital Pharma Platform Improvements

## Overview of Changes
Implement major workflow improvements to the Hospital Pharma Procurement Platform including a new label-based navigation system, enhanced visualizations, RCA/recommendations screen, and vendor forecast reporting.

---

## 1. NEW FIRST SCREEN - Label Dashboard (Landing Page After Login)

### Requirements:
Create a new landing page that displays procurement labels as the main navigation:

### Label Categories to Display:
1. **Over-Stocking** - Products with excess inventory
2. **Under-Stocking** - Products below optimal levels
3. **Expiry Risk** - Products nearing expiry (< 30 days)
4. **Wastage** - Products wasted due to expiry or damage
5. **Dead Stock** - Products with no movement (> 90 days)
6. **Stockout Risk** - Products at critical low levels
7. **High Velocity** - Fast-moving products requiring attention
8. **Slow Moving** - Products with declining consumption
9. **Emergency Shortage** - Critical medicines running low
10. **Cost Overrun** - Products exceeding budget allocation

### Label Card Design:
Each label should be displayed as a card showing:
- **Label Name** (large, bold text)
- **Affected Products Count** (e.g., "23 products")
- **Total Value/Quantity** affected
- **Status Icon** (Alert/Warning/Check icon)
- **Color-coded Border and Background**:
  - **Green**: All products normal (0-5 affected items)
  - **Yellow**: Moderate issues (6-15 affected items)
  - **Red**: Critical issues (16+ affected items)
- **Trend Indicator**: Arrow showing if situation is improving/worsening
- **Clickable** to navigate to detailed view

### Layout:
- Grid layout: 3-4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- Animated cards with hover effects (lift and shadow increase)
- Each card pulses gently if status is Red (critical)
- Sort cards by severity (Red first, then Yellow, then Green)

### Top Section:
- Show "Procurement Health Overview" heading
- Display overall health score (e.g., "78/100" with color indicator)
- Show last updated timestamp
- Quick stats: Total SKUs, Total Value, Active Alerts

### Synthetic Data Requirements:
Generate realistic data for each label:
- Product counts per label (mix of red/yellow/green states)
- Total monetary value affected
- Trend data (7-day history showing improvement/decline)
- Severity distribution across labels

---

## 2. SECOND SCREEN - Label-Specific Dashboard (After Clicking Label)

### Global Search Bar with Label Keywords:

#### Search Bar Features:
- **Position**: Top of page, full width, prominent placement
- **Placeholder**: "Search by label, product, category, or vendor..."
- **Auto-complete**: Show suggestions as user types
- **Label Keywords Display**: Below search bar, show clickable keyword chips:
  - All 10 label names as colored chips/badges
  - Currently selected label highlighted with blue border
  - Click any chip to instantly switch to that label's data
  - Smooth transition animation when switching labels

#### Remove Existing Search:
- **Delete the search bar from top-right corner** (beside logout)
- Keep only the new global search bar

### Tab Navigation:
Keep 3 tabs below the search bar:
1. **Overview** (existing)
2. **Product Journey** (existing)
3. **Product Improvement** (renamed from "Product Labeling")
   - Remove all "RL" or "RLHF" references
   - Update component names and UI text accordingly

---

## 3. OVERVIEW TAB - Second Screen Improvements

### A. Chord Diagram Modifications:

#### Left Side Color Change:
- **Remove individual colors** from left-side medicine categories
- **Use uniform blue color** for all left-side segments (same as right side)
- Keep labels: Emergency Medicines, OT Medicines, Ward Medicines, Daycare Medicines, General Medicines, Implant Medicines

#### Ribbon Styling:
- **Ribbon COLOR = Movement speed** (from movement legends):
  - Fast → Green
  - Medium → Yellow  
  - Slow → Orange
  - Occasional → Red
- **Ribbon THICKNESS = Consumption level**:
  - Thick → Over-consumption
  - Medium → Normal
  - Thin → Under-consumption
- This matches the reference screenshot

#### Ribbon Click Interaction:
- **On ribbon click**: Navigate to **Third Screen** (RCA & Recommendations)
- Pass data: medicine type, destination, flow volume, label context
- Smooth transition animation

#### Data Filtering by Selected Label:
- Chord diagram shows only data relevant to selected label from first screen
- Example: If "Over-Stocking" selected, show only over-consumed flows
- Update flow volumes, connections dynamically based on label

### B. Categories & Functions Section (NEW - Below Chord):

  - Progress bar showing allocation vs consumption

**Right Column - Affected Functions:**
- List 6-8 hospital functions/departments

- **Use uniform color** for all product nodes (e.g., slate blue #64748b)
- Keep existing info: Medicine name, Allocated quantity
- Keep pulse animation but slower (2s cycle instead of 1s)

#### Level 2 - Distribution Nodes:
- Keep as-is (Areas/Departments: ICU, Emergency, General Ward, etc.)
- Current stock display
- **Do NOT color-code these** - use neutral color

#### Level 3 - Usage Count Nodes (NEW):
- Show "Usage Count" for each distribution point
- Display: "Used: 450 units" (example)
- **COLOR-CODE based on flow**:
  - **Green**: Normal usage (80-120% of expected)
  - **Yellow**: Under-usage (<80% of expected)
  - **Red**: Over-usage (>120% of expected)
- Pulse animation speed varies by urgency

#### Level 4 - Available Stock Nodes (NEW):

- Current speed appears too fast - reduce to 40-50% of current speed
- Particles should flow smoothly and be clearly visible
- Particle color matches source node color
- Particle count increases with higher flow volume

### Interactivity:
- Click main product node → Open DetailDrawer (as currently implemented)
- Hover any node → Show tooltip with detailed stats
- Hover connection line → Highlight full path with glow effect
